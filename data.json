Secondly i had budget constraints (below 35k)... so I had to go for one with only HDD, not SSD. I would have loved hybrid types as those work excellent. Thus I opted for this laptop with no SSD, only 1TB HDD, however i preferred 8GB RAM... it has been 3 days and we have been using it for Zoom long meetings..and general surfing (no multimedia use yet). So far there are no visible issues. The fan sometimes gives out a slight burning smell and I assume it is because the circuitry is new... I shall monitor for more days and give another review on this. The laptop's nice feature is the CORTANA support by which windows got configured smoothly, with little intervention. it did take lot of time to boot initially, but now boots up fine.... Havent faced any sound or heat issues yet. Screen output quality could have been better..... to get the optimum brightness you have to raise the brightness to almost the limit. Sound output is not that great..... so far so good. will post again after a month of use.","rating":4},{"name":"Shantanu Verma","title":"Decent laptop, good customer support during setup","content":"I purchased GR0011AU (1TB HDD no SSD, Ryzen 3 3250). Economical Laptop with decent performance. Battery backup around 5.5 to 6 hrs on streaming video via wifi and general browsing. I avoided purchasing extended warranty online. Instead buy from the HP helpline (number attached in photo). Registration and setup of MS Office Home and Student 2019 is tricky as the laptop has Office 365 installed as default. This (365) has to be uninstalled and the Office H&S 2019 image (3.5GB) has to be downloaded and set up. I am doing it all through the HP helpline and they are helpful.. Overall decent/good laptop for my basic requirements and very good customer support, atleast during setup.","rating":4}]},{"For":"Travel","Brand":"Dell","RAM":"4 GB","Processor":"Intel","DisplaySize":"15.6","HasSSD":"Yes","title":"Dell Inspiron 3501 15.6` FHD Display Laptop (i3-1115G4 / 4GB / 256GB SSD / Integrated Graphics / Win10 + MSO / Accent Black)","category":"Laptops","price":38890,"imgs":["https://gitcdn.link/cdn/seebham/ecommerce-dummy-data/main/images/travelLaptop1.jpg","https://gitcdn.link/cdn/seebham/ecommerce-dummy-data/main/images/travelLaptop2.jpg"],"specs":["Processor:11th Generation Intel Core i3-1115G4 Processor (6MB Cache, up to 4.1 GHz)","Memory & Storage: 4GB, 4Gx1, DDR4, 2666MHz | 256GB M.2 PCIe NVMe Solid State Drive","Display: 15.6-inch FHD (1920 x 1080) Anti-glare LED Backlight Narrow Border WVA Display","Graphics: Intel UHD Graphics with shared graphics memory","Operating System & Software: Windows 10 Home Single Language | Microsoft Office Home and Student 2019","I/O ports: USB 3.2 Gen 1 (x2), USB2.0 (x1), HDMI 1.4(x1),One SD-card slot ,RJ45 - 10/100Mbps"],"inStock":19,"eta":180,"id":"l2","rating":4.3,"reviews":[{"name":"Adesh Gaurav","title":"Very good DELL laptop","content":"I got a nice and genuine DELL laptop.
